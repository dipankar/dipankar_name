We had just pitched to Maninder Gulati, who I knew from his previous avatar as an entrepreneur. He told us about this really interesting startup that he believed in completely, set us up with a meeting in Spaze, Gurugram.\nWe meet this founder, who was young, smart and ambitious. In comparison, I sounded jaded back then! He really needed help with his technology and processes. I thought about it, and it looked too messy back then to me.\nWe headed back to the boss and said maybe not the right opportunity for us. He was adamant that this would work (and well, he made it work).\nThe founder was Ritesh Agarwal and the company OYO which will probably do a mega IPO soon. What it has taken to pull this off I am assuming very few folks can do.\nIn hindsight, the lack of appreciation of business and venture capital did me in. They are an essential part of the eco-system and must be treated with respect.\nThe tech myopia ultimately does not help one succeed in being a part of large stories. One can only hope, other don\u0026rsquo;t take these opportunities as lightly as we did.\nKeep an open mind, and always look at what can transform that moment into something significant.\n#startup #venturecapital #business #respect #opportunity\n","date":null,"permalink":"/writings/what-you-cant-see-matters-always-keep-an-open-mind/","section":"My writings","summary":"This blog post delves into the author\u0026rsquo;s experience of meeting a young, ambitious Ritesh Agarwal, the founder of OYO, at an early stage in his journey.

We had made it with love, but sitting in my co-founder\u0026rsquo;s room in Kalkaji, New Delhi. We were competing with the valley boys and how (2007-9)!\nA whole decade before Koo India came Kwippy! So, Mayank Dhingra, K. A. Anand and me decided to take the rather hard plunge into the crazy world of microblogging startups by building Kwippy. We were moonlighting to build this out as we all worked in SlideShare back then. Saurabh Tuteja helped up think it through! Now, this was going to be hard, but we knew this would change our lives.\nNow the basics are still the same as with Twitter; you can post snippets. However, we took it one step ahead; we had a bot you could add on Yahoo messenger, AIM, ICQ, and MSN, which would log your status messages. (Yes, that was a growth hack!) also, we had a 100% compatible API with the Twitter API back then.\nSo technically, our users didn\u0026rsquo;t need to come to the site to post the content, and more so could push any content through their messengers. We ran this on a single VPS on Linode and well had scale (Alexa 500 worldwide at its best). We shipped swag to our US community manager, (Matthew Phillips) who helped us growth hack it to 20K+ US users back then and well, hopefully still remembers us after all these years. We ran the search backend on sphinx fulltext search, which is still a supremely underrated piece of software today!\nOf course, we didn\u0026rsquo;t survive (Twitter raised far too much money), but much of what we did was replicated (possibly independently) by Facebook and other networks. One such feature was to invite any friend into a conversation!\nWe did manage to get one termsheet though from a fund called Kuruvindium and nearly managed to be the first Indian startup to be TechCrunch ed!!! (Now thats another missed opportunity ;) )\n#startups #growth #india #twitter #hosting #funding #notaunicorn\n","date":null,"permalink":"/writings/bharat-ka-twitter/","section":"My writings","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Made with love in California\u0026rdquo; - Talk about a one-line growth hack.
